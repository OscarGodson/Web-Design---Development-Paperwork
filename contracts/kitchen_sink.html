			<h1>Web Development Agreement</h1>
			<p>This contract defines the terms of agreement between us</p>
		</header>
		<article>
			<section>
				<h2>Introduction:</h2>
				<p>This contract (the CONTRACT) serves as legally binding agreement between two parties, I Oscar Godson, the web developer (the DEVELOPER) and you, the client (the CLIENT) in relation to a project to be completed by the DEVELOPER for the CLIENT (the WORK) as defined in the Estimate and/or Proposal documents (the PROJECT DOCUMENTS).</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Pricing and Payment:</h2>
				<p>Projects are billed hourly or by the project, depending on the scope of the work. Specific fees and payment terms will be detailed in your project proposal. Final payment is due within 30 days of the invoice date, unless otherwise noted. A 25% of monthly service charge is assessed on all unpaid invoices over 30 days. Fees are non-refundable. Finished work not approved by the CLIENT beyond 30 days shall be billed as completed unless exceptoinal circumstances prevent the CLIENT from reasonably doing so. There will be a $15.00 fee on all returned checks, plus any additional bank fees, interest charges, finance charges, over draft charges, or other fees resulting from charges billed by the DEVELOPER.</p>
				<p>The CLIENT will assume responsibility for all collection of fees necessitated by default in payment. Accounts that are collectable by the DEVELOPER may be turned over to an outside collection agency for collection.</p>
				<p>The DEVELOPER may request a progressive payment option at his discretion which will be expressed in the estimate (for example: invoicing <sup>1/2</sup> of the estimated project fees before work begins and <sup>1/2</sup> due at project completetion).
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Estimates</h2>
				<p>The DEVELOPER will make every effort to be as accurate and complete as possible on estimates. To recieve a project estimate, the CLIENT must submit the exact specification of the WORK. In some cases, a range estimate will be given, based on knowledge of the project at the time of the estimate. If, upon receipt of all project elements, the DEVELOPER determines the scope of the project has been changed from the originally agreed-upon concept, the project may be re-estimated. If the CLIENT does not agree to this new fee, completed work will be billed either - at the choice of the CLIENT - at a pro-rated cost based on work complete, in which case the CLIENT will own the work completed to the point, or 20% of the original estimate and the CLIENT will relinquish any rights to the WORK to the DEVELOPER. In Either CASE, the CONTRACT will be terminated.</p>
				<p>Minor revisions are anticipated, but major design/content changes may go beyond the scope of the estimate and are the domain of a support agreement. The CLIENT's approval will be obtained for any increases in fees or expenses that exceed the original estimate by 10%. Final fees and expenses will be shown when invoice is rendered. Estimate is valid for 30 days from date of estimate. All outsourced fees will be estimated separately.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Expenses:</h2>
				<p>Out-of-pocket expenses will be subject to an industry-standard markup to cover time and costs involved. Unless projected to be costly, they will not be included in the estimate. Any expenses expected to be above $25 will be discussed with the CLIENT. The CLIENT shall reimburse the DEVELOPER for expenses arising from this project, including but not limited to: photography, fonts, scanning, digital proofs, production expenses, long distance, postage, travel, sales tax (when applicable), messenger services, shipping, hiring of contract, writers/designers, software, and printing fees.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Approvals:</h2>
				<p>The CLIENT will be ultimately responsible for final approval of all materials. It is important to make all corrections before final approval to avoid delays and additional fees. Upon final approval the CLIENT assumes all liability for the WORK. In no case will the DEVELOPER be held liable for any work that has been approved by the CLIENT.</p>
				<p>The CLIENT is responsible for contacting the DEVELOPER within 30 days regarding approval unless exceptional circumstances prevent the CLIENT from doing so. Matieral neither approved nor rejected after this time period may be treated as approved by the DEVELOPER.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Completion and Delivery Dates:</h2>
				<p>Any delay in the completion of a project due to <em>force majeure</em> (external forces beyond the DEVELOPER's control) such as unusual transportation delays, unforeseen problems at a vendor site, a computer/Internet related issues, holidays, bad road conditions, et cetra, or actions and negligence of the CLIENT (i.e., content delivery delays), shall entitle the DEVELOPER to extend the completion/delivery date, upon notifying the CLIENT, by the time equivalent of sich a delay. The DEVELOPER will not be held liable for such delays.</p>
				<p>If the DEVELOPER is significantly or repeatedly late, on deadlines, the CLIENT has the right to request a reduction of 25% of the estimated fee or to terminate the CONTRACT with no penalty.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Cancellation:</h2>
				<p>In the event of cancellation of a project by the CLIENT, the ownership of all copyrights and original artwork, including sketches, layout, code, and any other mockups, shall be retained by the DEVELOPER. Any usage by the CLIENT with of the project elements will result in appropriate legal action.</p>
			<p>A cancellation fee for work completed shall be paid by the CLIENT. The cancellation fee is as follows: 25% of total project fee for preliminary work, concepts, or comps, 50% of total project fee after preliminary work by before completion, 100% of total project fee for completed work regardless of final approval.</p>
			<p>In th event of cancellation by the DEVELOPER, the CLIENT will be responsible for 50% of the pro-rated cost for work done, and will retain ownership of the materials defined in Creative and Intellectual Property.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Additional Usage:</h2>
				<p>If the CLIENT wishes to make additional uses of the work, CLIENT shall seek permission from the DEVELOPER and pay an additional fee to be agred upon at such a time. Additional uses include any use beyond the use of the WORK on one website, for example: resale, reuse, et cetra.</p>

The DEVELOPER will provide hosting for a reasonable period of time to facilitate development of the WORK, but this hosting may be revoked for any reason by the DEVELOPER with no notice to the CLIENT. The DEVELOPER agrees to store a completed copy of the WORK for no less than one year from approval to facilitate transfer to the CLIENT, but the DEVELOPER cannot be held responsible for the CLIENT's loss of this work beyond this time.</p>
				<p>In some cases, the CLIENT may purchase web hosting from the DEVELOPER; such cases are beyond the scope of this agreement and will be defined in a separate agreement.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Client Responsibilities:</h2>

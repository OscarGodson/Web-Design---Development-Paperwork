#Web Design and Development Contracts

##About
These are a soon to be set of contracts for any designer or developer to use. The contracts come in HTML format for easy cross platform development, but are styled for a 8.5x11 printout. Feel free to modify and distribute.

###Note:
"Kitchen Sink" contracts are the big contracts with everything you could possibly think of.

##Coming Soon
Below is a list of all the paperwork in progress:

* Retainer Contracts
* Estimates
  * With "live" editing and estimation via javascript
* Proposals

If you want something else, let me know!
